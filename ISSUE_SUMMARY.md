# üö® Issue Summary - Duplicate Video Bug

## **Current Status: UNRESOLVED** 

Despite implementing multiple layers of filtering and validation, the duplicate video issue persists.

## **The Problem**
- **Same video URL appears in multiple lessons**: `https://youtu.be/65GvYDdzJWU`
- **Affected lessons**: THE GRAND VISION, v55, v56, v57, v60, and potentially more
- **Expected behavior**: Each lesson should have its own unique video or "No video found"

## **What's Been Tried**

### 1. **Method-Specific Blacklists** ‚ùå FAILED
- Added video ID filtering to individual extraction methods
- **Result**: Duplicate videos found alternative paths

### 2. **Position-Based Filtering** ‚ùå FAILED  
- Skip video elements positioned in header areas (Y < 200px)
- **Result**: Cached videos weren't necessarily in header positions

### 3. **Container-Specific Scanning** ‚ùå FAILED
- Only scan for videos within lesson content containers
- **Result**: Cached videos still getting through

### 4. **Centralized Validation System** ‚ùå STILL FAILING
- Created global `is_valid_lesson_video()` function
- ALL extraction methods must validate through this single checkpoint
- **Blacklist**: `["YTrIwmIdaJI", "UDcrRdfB0x8", "7snrj0uEaDw", "65GvYDdzJWU"]`
- **Result**: Duplicates still appearing (validation may be bypassed somehow)

## **Technical Implementation**

### **Current Architecture**
```python
def extract_video_url(driver):
    # Method 1: JSON extraction ‚Üí validate ‚Üí return or reject
    # Method 2: Click player ‚Üí validate ‚Üí return or reject  
    # Method 3: Iframe scan ‚Üí validate ‚Üí return or reject
    # Method 4: Legacy scan ‚Üí validate ‚Üí return or reject
    
def is_valid_lesson_video(video_url):
    # Extract video ID and check against blacklist
    # Should block: 65GvYDdzJWU and others
```

### **Expected Console Output**
```
üö´ BLOCKED cached video: 65GvYDdzJWU from URL: https://youtu.be/65GvYDdzJWU
‚ö†Ô∏è No valid lesson video found with any extraction method
```

## **Root Cause Theories**

1. **Validation Bypass**: The centralized validation isn't being called for some reason
2. **JavaScript Injection**: Video URLs are being injected after validation
3. **Session State**: Browser/driver state carrying over between lessons
4. **JSON Data Contamination**: The `__NEXT_DATA__` itself contains the cached video
5. **Extraction Method Bug**: One of the 4 extraction methods has a bug that bypasses validation

## **Next Developer Tasks**

### **Immediate Investigation**
1. **Add debug logging** to see which extraction method is returning the duplicate
2. **Verify validation function** is actually being called
3. **Check console output** for expected blocking messages
4. **Examine `debug_lesson_data.json`** to see if duplicate is in raw JSON

### **Potential Solutions**
1. **Browser session isolation** - use fresh browser instance for each lesson
2. **Aggressive state clearing** - clear cache/cookies between lessons  
3. **Method elimination** - disable methods one by one to isolate the source
4. **Lesson-specific validation** - validate video actually belongs to current lesson

## **Success Criteria**
- ‚úÖ Each lesson has unique video URL or "No video found"
- ‚úÖ Console shows blocking messages for known duplicates
- ‚úÖ `find_duplicate_videos.py` reports "NO DUPLICATE VIDEOS FOUND"

## **Files to Focus On**
- **`skool_content_extractor.py`** - Main extraction logic (lines 1741-1785)
- **`is_valid_lesson_video()`** - Validation function (lines 729-760)
- **Console output** - Should show blocking messages if working
- **Communities folder** - Check `.md` files for duplicate video URLs

**This is a persistent caching/state issue that requires deeper investigation into the extraction flow.** üîç
