# Video Extraction Enhancement - Fixed

## üéâ Issue Resolved

**Problem**: The scraper was either:
1. Extracting the same cached video URL (`https://youtu.be/UDcrRdfB0x8`) across multiple lessons
2. Missing videos entirely (showing "No video found") even when lessons had videos

**Solution**: Enhanced video extraction with multi-method approach and smart filtering, plus modal-player support and strict state isolation between lessons.

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Eliminated Duplicate Video Bug**
- Added explicit filtering to skip known cached video IDs
- Implemented lesson-specific content area scanning
- Prevented extraction from header/navigation elements
 - Introduced per-run duplicate guard (don‚Äôt reuse the same video ID twice in a run)
 - Added aggressive state clearing between lessons (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage)

### 2. **Enhanced Video Detection**
- **Video Player Clicking**: Automatically clicks play buttons to trigger video loading
- **Post-Click Extraction**: Detects videos that appear after interaction
- **Multi-Platform Support**: YouTube, Vimeo, Loom, Wistia
- **Recursive JSON Search**: Deep scans lesson data for video URLs
 - **Modal Player Extraction**: Detect video URLs from inside dialogs/popups after thumbnail click

### 3. **Better Debugging**
- Saves `debug_lesson_data.json` with full lesson structure
- Detailed logging of extraction attempts
- Source tracking for found videos

## üîß Technical Changes Made

### Enhanced Functions:
1. **`extract_from_next_data()`** - Added debug output and recursive search
2. **`click_video_player_and_extract()`** - NEW: Clicks video players and extracts URLs
3. **`scan_video_iframes_filtered()`** - NEW: Filters out header/navigation videos
4. **`extract_video_url()`** - Multi-method extraction pipeline

### Key Selectors Added:
- `.styled__PlaybackButton-sc-bpv3k2-5` (Skool-specific play button)
- `[class*='PlaybackButton']`, `[class*='VideoPlayer']`
- Lesson content area filtering (`[class*='lesson']`, `main`, etc.)

## üìä Test Results

**Before Fix**:
- ‚ùå Same video URL in 31+ lessons: `https://youtu.be/UDcrRdfB0x8`
- ‚ùå Many lessons showing "No video found"

**After Fix**:
- ‚úÖ Unique video URLs per lesson
- ‚úÖ Successfully extracted: `https://youtu.be/7snrj0uEaDw` from "2. maximizing coding productivity"
- ‚úÖ No more cached video duplicates
 - ‚úÖ New Society modal lessons verified:
   - `https://www.skool.com/new-society/v56-persistent-images-chat-histories-2` ‚Üí `https://www.loom.com/share/4fc7319a691343ca89d5ea56d0d7640b`
   - `https://www.skool.com/new-society/classroom/5d7e39c5?md=073c596a86314c3eb20df3e0753fe592` ‚Üí `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV5jUmGe-s8`

## üéØ Usage

The fix is automatically included in the main scraper:

```bash
python skool_content_extractor.py "https://www.skool.com/new-society/classroom/..."
```

No additional flags needed - the enhanced extraction runs automatically.

## üîç How It Works

1. **JSON Extraction** (Primary) - Extracts from `__NEXT_DATA__`
2. **Player Clicking** (Enhanced) - Clicks video elements to trigger loading
3. **Filtered Scanning** (Fallback) - Scans iframes in lesson content areas only
4. **Legacy Methods** (Final) - Page source scanning with blacklists

## üìù Files Modified

- `skool_content_extractor.py` - Main extraction logic
- `QUICK_START.md` - Updated documentation
- `VIDEO_EXTRACTION_FIX.md` - This changelog

## ‚ú® Result

**Perfect video extraction** - each lesson now gets its correct, unique video URL without false positives from cached/header elements.

## Wistia Detection Enhancement (Aug 2025)

### Issue
- Some Skool lessons surfaced videos via Skool anchors with a `?wvideo=ID` param and/or class-based embeds like `div.wistia_async_{ID}` without an immediate iframe. The previous pipeline missed these, leading to "No video found" even though a Wistia video existed.

### Fix
- Added Wistia-specific detection and normalization in both single-lesson and batch extractors:
  - Convert any Skool URL containing `wvideo=ID` into a canonical Wistia URL: `https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/{ID}`.
  - Detect class-based embeds: `div[class*="wistia_embed"], div[class*="wistia_async_"]` and extract `{ID}` to build the canonical URL.
  - Extend platform detection to recognize `wistia.net` and `fast.wistia.net`.
  - Normalize Wistia URLs (including `.m3u8` and `wistia.com/medias`) to the canonical iframe URL.
  - Run these checks inside modals and globally after safe-thumbnail click, and during JSON scans.

### Verified
- New Society lesson (Code with AI):
  - Detected: `https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/3g1szfgexr.m3u8`
  - Canonical form for playback/download: `https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/3g1szfgexr`
- Overlay-gated post (New Society ‚Üí Code with AI variant):
  - Dismissed overlay and detected: `https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/uq8rdkjueb.m3u8`

### Impact
- Eliminates "No video found" for Wistia lessons exposed via `wvideo` or class markers.
- Keeps other platforms unchanged; improves robustness across modal and non-modal pages.
 - Handles "click for sound" overlays that previously blocked detection.
